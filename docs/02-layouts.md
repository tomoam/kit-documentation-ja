title: Layouts
---

So far, we've treated pages as entirely standalone components â€” upon navigation, the existing component will be destroyed, and a new one will take its place.

But in many apps, there are elements that should be visible on _every_ page, such as top-level navigation or a footer. Instead of repeating them in every page, we can use _layout_ components.

To create a layout component that applies to every page, make a file called `src/routes/$layout.svelte`. The default layout component (the one that SvelteKit uses if you don't bring your own) looks like this...

```html
<slot></slot>
```

...but we can add whatever markup, styles and behaviour we want. For example, let's add a nav bar:

```html
<!-- src/routes/$layout.svelte -->
<nav>
	<a href=".">Home</a>
	<a href="about">About</a>
	<a href="settings">Settings</a>
</nav>

<slot></slot>
```

If we create pages for `/`, `/about` and `/settings`...

```html
<!-- src/routes/index.svelte -->
<h1>Home</h1>
```

```html
<!-- src/routes/about.svelte -->
<h1>About</h1>
```

```html
<!-- src/routes/settings.svelte -->
<h1>Settings</h1>
```

...the nav will always be visible, and clicking between the three pages will only result in the `<h1>` being replaced.

### Nested layouts

Suppose we don't just have a single `/settings` page, but instead have nested pages like `/settings/profile` and `/settings/notifications` with a shared submenu (for a real-life example, see [github.com/settings](https://github.com/settings)).

We can create a layout that only applies to pages below `/settings` (while inheriting the root layout with the top-level nav):

```html
<!-- src/routes/settings/$layout.svelte -->
<h1>Settings</h1>

<div class="submenu">
	<a href="/settings/profile">Profile</a>
	<a href="/settings/notifications">Notifications</a>
</div>

<slot></slot>
```


### Error pages

If your page fails to load (see [Loading](#loading)), SvelteKit will render an error page. You can customise this page by creating a file called `src/routes/$error.svelte`, which is a component that receives an `error` prop alongside a `status` code:

```html
<script>
	export let status;
	export let error;
</script>

<h1>{status}</h1>
<p>{error.message}</p>
```
